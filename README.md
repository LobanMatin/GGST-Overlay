# Game Overlay for the game Guilty-Gear-Strive
The overlay is aimed towards achieving more efficient access to framedata and other relevant information.
The application uses a web scraper to retrieve character framedata from https://www.dustloop.com/w/GGST and store it in a database.
The data can then be accessed and displayed as a overlay.


The overlay can also be minimised and maximised via a keyboard shortcut to allow for quick access even when in-game.
